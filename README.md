## Generate `.POT` file

We need to generate a `.pot` file. This file is a catalog of unprocessed messages, these messages are those translatable strings that we have marked in our program, in this case with `_` that we put before the string that we want to translate.

You can use this command to generate `.pot` file.

```bash
pygettext -d base -p locale main.py
```

ðŸš¨The previous command is not working for me. I need to use `pygettext.py` because my OS has some problems with that. If you have problems too, you can use the next command:

```bash
python pygettext.py -d base -o locale/base.pot main.py
```
